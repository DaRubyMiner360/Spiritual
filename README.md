Spiritual is a communication tool made for chating.<!--- It is primarily made for chating about Spirit Engine though.-->

## Getting Started
You can download the jar files).
Then run the client jar file and put in the info that you might get, or the info from the Spiritual Server.
If you are hosting your own Spiritual Server, figure out how to put the server jar file on a server

You can also clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/DaRubyMiner360/Spiritual/`

You can also clone the development repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/DaRubyMiner360/Spiritual-Development`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## The Plan
The plan for Spiritual is two-fold: to create a powerful communication tool.
